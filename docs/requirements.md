# Cat Trivia
**Estimated time:** 1-2 hours

## Requirements
1. On app start, use an API https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/ to get a random cat fact
2. Display fact text and its creation date formatted for the current device locale
3. Show a random cat image by using https://cataas.com/cat
4. Add button ‘Another fact!’ → load and show a new random fact + image when pressing it
5. Show some kind of loading animation while the fact & image is loading.
6. Save the facts that have been displayed so far
7. Add a button ‘Fact history’ that navigates to a new screen listing all the saved facts (show only fact text and creation date, no image necessary)
8. Upload your code to the GitHub repository and add the DEMO video of your working application

## Constraints
1. Use Flutter BLoC package for State Management
2. Use Retrofit package for API communication
3. Use Hive for storing data on the device

## Advices
1. Keep the code as clean as possible
2. Extract everything that can be considered reusable
3. Compose the UI ergonomically
4. You should be satisfied with the result. Don’t forget to have fun!
